From Milazzo, you can admire a landscape that extends to the famous Aeolian Islands, the "seven nuggets" of the Mediterranean, which seem to emerge from the horizon, testifying to a beauty that has no equal. Milazzo is a place that stimulates the mind and enchants the heart, where every step brings you closer to a new discovery, between the magic of the past and the beauty of an unparalleled natural landscape.</p>

<div id="colazione" class="hidden">
    <h2>Let's gather some energy</h2>
    <p>Before starting to discover the wonders of Milazzo, take a moment to recharge your energy with a typical Sicilian breakfast. Although the tradition is decidedly sweet and caloric, the dishes are always plant-based, for a wake-up rich in local flavors. In summer, a true Sicilian would never give up granita with brioche for dipping, but the delights don't end there: cannoli, cassata, and croissants are just some of the delicacies you can taste, perhaps accompanied by a good espresso or a fresh Sicilian orange juice. Sit in a caf√© in the center and let yourself be won over by this sweet start to the day.</p>

<div id="capoMilazzo" class="hidden">
    <h2>Here we are at Capo Milazzo</h2>
    <p>Capo Milazzo is the tip of the Milazzo peninsula and is undoubtedly the most natural and fascinating area of the city. A short distance from the center, it offers an experience immersed in nature, while remaining easily accessible.</p>
    <p>This promontory marks the meeting point between the two sides of the peninsula and offers breathtaking panoramas, with a view that extends to the <strong>seven Aeolian islands</strong>. Its lush vegetation is a true treasure of biodiversity, giving life to an ecosystem called <strong>"Mediterranean machine"</strong> for its extraordinary ability to adapt and thrive. Here, away from the chaos of the city, you can experience complete immersion in nature.</p>
    <p>Among the main attractions of Capo Milazzo, you'll find the suggestive <strong>Church of Sant'Antonio di Paola</strong>, carved into the rock, which offers a spiritual dimension to the landscape. Not far away, there's <strong>Gigliopoli</strong>, a private villa that, upon request, can be visited to discover a corner of unspoiled and protected nature.</p>
    <p>But the true pearl of Capo Milazzo is the <strong>Pool of Venus</strong>, an enchanting natural inlet, where the crystal-clear sea and the rock merge to create a scene of rare beauty. <strong>That's exactly where we're heading.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Attention:</strong> The path that will take us to the <strong>Pool of Venus</strong> includes a staircase that might be tiring, especially on the way back. Before undertaking the walk, consider the effort you will face and, most importantly, remember to hydrate, as high temperatures in the area can increase the fatigue of the journey.</p>
    
    <p>Let's now head towards the <strong>Pool of Venus</strong>, an enchanting natural corner immersed in the heart of the protected marine area. The path is well-marked and well-preserved, crossing an untouched area that has seen an important ecological recovery work. Thanks to the commitment of some volunteers, the <strong>Mediterranean machine</strong> and marine biodiversity, such as marine flora and corals, have been restored, creating ideal conditions for marine life to flourish and thrive.</p>
    
    <p>Once we arrive, let's be fascinated by the breathtaking panorama surrounding us. We could settle on one of the rocks to enjoy the beauty of the place. If we wish, we can also carefully immerse ourselves in the natural pool, a place where the crystal-clear sea perfectly blends with the surrounding rocks, creating an idyllic environment. It's truly a unique place, a corner of paradise that deserves to be experienced in all its beauty.</p>

    <p>Having arrived at the village of Milazzo, let's be captivated by the unique atmosphere of this ancient and vibrant corner of the city. Although it's the most historic area of Milazzo, the village is anything but sleepy. On the contrary, it's a neighborhood animated by numerous restaurants and caf√©s where you can taste typical dishes or simply sip a drink. If you want a complete lunch, why not try a dish of the freshest fish, caught directly from the surrounding waters? If instead you want to experience an even more "local" experience, a plate of pasta with a good Sicilian sauce will give you an authentic delight for the palate.</p>

    <p>For those who have little time or have brought their lunch with them, there's a special corner worth discovering: a panoramic point that offers a spectacular view. From here, you can admire the Castle of Milazzo from a unique perspective, with a breathtaking view of the beach below and the islands on the horizon.

But hey, it's not time to stop yet! Rather, I would say it's the perfect time to head towards the beach and enjoy the sea.</p>
    <p>On the western side, you'll find Milazzo's most beloved bathing area. Here, crystal clear waters and spacious beaches await you. The beauty of these beaches is that, despite being very popular, they are wide enough to never (almost) seem crowded, so you'll have plenty of space to enjoy the sea in complete comfort.</p>
    <p>And while you relax, you'll have before you a sight that's not easily forgotten: the panorama of the sea and the Aeolian Islands. A view that will make you feel as if time has stopped, a corner of paradise that will surely make you appreciate this part of Sicily even more. In short, take a breath, refresh yourself, and prepare to admire one of the most beautiful landscapes this city has to offer!</p>

    <h2>Baia del Tono</h2>
    <p>The Western Beach is the ideal place for those seeking tranquility and relaxation, while not giving up the beauty of a breathtaking landscape. Long and spacious, the beach offers numerous spots where you can stop and enjoy the sea. If you prefer to avoid crowds, you can choose any point along the coast, always finding a quiet area to lie in the sun or take a refreshing swim in the crystal-clear waters. However, I recommend continuing to the end of the promenade, where you'll find Baia del Tono, also known as "Ngonia" in Sicilian, a spot that will leave you speechless.</p>
    <p>This bay is framed by wild and unspoiled nature, creating an idyllic scene that is perfect for those seeking peace and beauty. The sea here is particularly clear and the waters, which gently slope down, are perfect for swimming or simply walking along the shore. Moreover, this area offers a wide range of services: bars, restaurants, and beach establishments where you can rent sun loungers and umbrellas for greater comfort.</p>
    <p>If you enjoy water activities, you can take advantage of local offerings for sports such as kayaking, paddleboarding, or even try some boat excursions. The combination of relaxation and fun opportunities makes Baia del Tono an unmissable stop for visitors to this area.</p>

    <h2>Beach Time</h2>
    <p>Once we arrive at the shore, let's head towards the part of the beach that we like the most. The Western Beach offers several options, so you can choose whether to set up at one of the beach establishments, where you can rent an umbrella and sun loungers for a day of complete comfort, or, if you prefer a simpler and more natural solution, you can opt for the free beach. In any case, you don't have to worry about finding space, as the beach is wide and welcoming.</p>
    <p>As we approach the end of the bay, the scenery becomes even more suggestive. The panorama opens onto crystal clear waters and wild nature that frames the landscape, making every corner a perfect place to enjoy the sea and tranquility. I recommend relaxing a bit on the beach, taking advantage of the cool waters to refresh yourself with a nice swim.</p>
    <p>If after some relaxation you still want to explore, I recommend taking a short route that will lead you towards the rocks of the bay. This path offers spectacular views and will allow you to discover hidden corners of the shoreline. <strong>Be careful during the excursion among the rocks, as the terrain can be slippery and uneven.</strong> You can start the path from this point: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yXKCHSoBy88C1mZr6" target="_blank">click here for the map</a>.</p>

<div id="attivitaSpiaggiaA" class="hidden">
    <h2>Water activities</h2>
    <p>If you're still feeling adventurous, at one of the beach establishments you can rent a kayak or paddleboard and set off to explore the surroundings. I recommend heading towards the part of the bay that lies behind the promontory visible from the beach. Pass the reef and then turn right, following the coastline from that point onwards.</p>
    <p>This area is within Milazzo's marine protected area, a corner of wild and untouched nature, where marine flora is preserved and the water is particularly clear. However, it's important to be cautious and <strong>pay attention</strong>, as some stretches might be more difficult to navigate and currents stronger.</p>
    <p>Plan your route so you don't go too far. Remember that your safety is the priority, so try to measure the time and energy at your disposal. My advice is to think of this activity in a way that doesn't exceed an hour, so you have time to return without rushing before daylight starts to fade. It's not pleasant to be in the water with a kayak or paddleboard when night falls.</p>
    <p>Always maintain caution, paying attention to safety, and enjoy the experience.</p>

<div id="tramontoTonoA" class="hidden">
    <h2>Sunset at Baia del Tono</h2>
    <p>The time has finally come to experience one of the most beautiful and anticipated spectacles of the day: the sunset. A magical moment, which gives unique emotions every day, transforming the bay into a painting with breathtaking colors.</p>
    <p>My personal advice is to enjoy this moment directly by getting comfortable on the sand and letting yourself be enchanted by the natural spectacle that unfolds before you. The sky is tinged with shades of orange, pink, and purple, while the sea reflects every change of light in a fascinating way. If you want to make the experience even more enjoyable, bring something to snack on and a cool drink to sip on. To know the exact time of sunset, you can consult this resource: <a href="https://www.calendariando.it/alba-e-tramonto/milazzo/">Sunset Time in Milazzo</a>, so you don't miss even a moment of this enchanting spectacle.</p>
    <p>If you prefer a bit more comfort, an alternative is to settle in one of the beach bars. From here, you can enjoy the sunset while sipping an aperitif, as the sun slowly lowers to the horizon. Every minute that passes, the landscape changes, offering new shades and new emotions, while the sky and sea merge in perfect harmony.</p>
    <p>This is the opportunity to completely relax, let yourself be enveloped by the serenity of the moment. There's nothing more beautiful than watching the sunset as the sky colors and the sea shines under the light of the last ray of sun.</p>
    <p>Enjoy this unique experience, which will stay in your heart, and let yourself be lulled by the timeless beauty of Baia del Tono.</p>

<!-- 18. A12 - Return to Center -->
<div id="rientroCentroA" class="hidden">
    <h2>Return to Center</h2>
    <p>At this point, it's time to think about dinner. You might decide to stay near Baia del Tono and enjoy dinner at one of the restaurants on the beach, taking advantage of the panorama and tranquility that this area offers as the sun sets. However, it might be a good idea to return to the city center, where you'll find a greater variety of restaurants, trattorias, and venues offering typical dishes of Sicilian tradition.</p>
    <p>If you prefer some rest before dinner, you could stop by your accommodation to relax a bit and freshen up. Alternatively, if you're ready for dinner, you can head directly to the center, where the lively atmosphere and variety of venues will allow you to taste the flavors of local cuisine, perhaps while sipping a good glass of Sicilian wine.</p>

    <h3>How to reach the center:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On foot:</strong> If you took public transport and waited until sunset, unfortunately it's likely that there are no more buses available at that time. In this case, you'll have to take a nice walk to return to the center. At least it will be an excellent way to stimulate your appetite and prepare for an abundant dinner, and it will allow you to enjoy the city at night, with a calm and serene atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>By car:</strong> If you have a car, you can follow the directions to the city center, which is just a few minutes from the bay. However, be prepared for some traffic during peak hours and consider that finding parking might not be easy. The best solution is to look for parking in areas with blue stripes, where you'll easily find an available spot. Arm yourself with patience, and remember that this will allow you to best enjoy the evening in the center. You can conveniently pay for parking using the <strong>EasyPark</strong> app. Download it from this link: <a href="https://www.easypark.com/en-it/download?utm_source=Web&utm_campaign=IT_one_web_download_app&utm_medium=marketing" target="_blank">EasyPark App</a></li>

    <p>Cape Milazzo is the tip of the Milazzo peninsula and is undoubtedly the most natural and fascinating area of the city. A short distance from the center, it offers an experience immersed in nature, while remaining easily accessible.</p>
    <p>This promontory marks the meeting point between the two sides of the peninsula and offers breathtaking views, with a vista that extends to the <strong>seven Aeolian Islands</strong>. Its lush vegetation is a true treasure trove of biodiversity, giving life to an ecosystem called <strong>"Mediterranean machine"</strong> for its extraordinary ability to adapt and thrive. Here, away from the chaos of the city, you can experience complete immersion in nature.</p>
    <p>Among the main attractions of Cape Milazzo, you'll find the evocative <strong>Church of St. Anthony of Paola</strong>, carved into the rock, which offers a spiritual dimension to the landscape. Not far away, there's <strong>Gigliopoli</strong>, a private villa that, upon request, can be visited to discover a corner of untouched and protected nature.</p>
    <p>But the true pearl of Cape Milazzo is the <strong>Pool of Venus</strong>, an enchanting natural inlet, where the crystal-clear sea and the rock blend to create a scenario of rare beauty. <strong>That's exactly where we're headed.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Attention:</strong> The path that will lead us to the <strong>Pool of Venus</strong> includes a staircase that might be tiring, especially on the way back. Before embarking on the journey, consider the effort you'll have to face and, above all, remember to hydrate, as the high temperatures in the area can increase the fatigue of the route.</p>
    
    <p>Let's now head to the <strong>Pool of Venus</strong>, an enchanting natural corner immersed in the heart of the protected marine area. The path is well-traced and well-preserved, crossing an untouched area that has seen an important ecological recovery work. Thanks to the commitment of some volunteers, the <strong>Mediterranean machine</strong> and marine biodiversity, such as marine flora and corals, have been restored, creating ideal conditions for marine life to flourish and thrive.</p>

    <h3>How to get to the center:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On foot:</strong> If you took public transport and waited until sunset, unfortunately, it's likely that there are no more buses available at that time. In this case, you'll have to take a nice walk back to the center. At least it will be a great way to stimulate your appetite and prepare for a hearty dinner, and it will allow you to enjoy the city at night, with a calm and serene atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>By car:</strong> If you have a car, you can follow the signs to the city center, which is just a few minutes from the cape. However, be prepared for some traffic during peak hours and consider that finding parking might not be easy. The best solution is to look for parking in the blue-lined areas, where you'll easily find an available spot. Arm yourself with patience, and remember that this will allow you to better enjoy the evening in the center.

    <h2>Bars and Nightlife</h2>
    <p>
        If after dinner you feel like extending your evening, Milazzo offers some pleasant options to experience its nighttime atmosphere. You can decide to visit one of the pubs in the center, where you can sip a drink and, sometimes, listen to live music, which helps create a convivial and relaxed environment. It's the ideal place to enjoy the evening in company, perhaps with a chat or simply observing life flowing in the center.
        <br><br>
        If instead you're in the mood for something more lively, you can check out the events of the evening. Depending on the day of the week, there are outdoor dance parties, both along the Ponente coast and in the Capo Milazzo area. These places are perfect for those who want to have fun and dance under the stars, with the sea breeze making the atmosphere even more suggestive. An ideal opportunity for those seeking an evening of entertainment, among music and movement, in a unique and characteristic setting.
